### hello there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="22">

Hi, I'm a DevOps Engineer from Bucharest, specializing in Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux 🖥️. In my work, I focus on creating efficient and reliable systems through automation and scripting 🛠️. Outside of tech, I'm passionate about archery 🏹 and playing the saxophone 🎷, which gives me a great balance between precision and creativity. I'm also pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity 🎓, aiming to add an extra layer of safety to the digital world 🌐. Whether it's hitting the perfect note or the bullseye, I bring the same level of dedication to my hobbies as I do to my professional life.
